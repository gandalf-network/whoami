# whoami.tv

[whoami.tv](https://whoami.tv/) is a fun, sharable web application that shows users all kinds of cool facts and stats about their TV taste based on their Netflix viewing history.

## How it works

- Data Collection: Users authorize our application to collect their viewing data via Gandalf.
- Data Enrichment: We fetch additional show details such as actors, episode counts, rotten tomato scores and images from TMDB and RottenTomato.
- Insight Generation: Our algorithms analyze the collected data to extract meaningful insights about viewing patterns and preferences.
- Personality Creation: Based on the analysis, We use OpenAI assistants and Perplexity create personality profiles that reflects each userâ€™s TV show preferences.
