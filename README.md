# whoami.tv

[whoami.tv](https://whoami.tv/) is a fun, sharable web application that shows users all kinds of cool facts and stats about their TV taste based on their Netflix viewing history.

## How it works

- Data Collection: Users authorize our application to collect their Netflix viewing data via [Gandalf](https://gandalf.network/).
- Data Enrichment: We fetch additional show details such as actors, episode counts, rotten tomato scores and images from [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) and [RottenTomato](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/).
- Insight Generation: Our algorithms analyze the collected data to extract meaningful insights about viewing patterns and preferences.
- Personality Creation: Based on the analysis, We use [OpenAI assistants](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) and [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/) to create personality profiles that reflects each userâ€™s TV show preferences.
