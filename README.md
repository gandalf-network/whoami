# whoami. tv

[whoami. tv](https://whoami.tv/) is a fun, shareable web application that shows users all kinds of cool facts and stats about their TV taste based on their Netflix viewing history.

## How it works

- Data Collection: Users authorize our application to collect their Netflix viewing data via [Gandalf](https://gandalf.network/).
- Data Enrichment: We fetch additional show details such as actors, episode counts, rotten tomato scores, and images from [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) and [RottenTomato](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/).
- Insight Generation: Our algorithms analyze the collected data to extract meaningful insights about viewing patterns and preferences.
- Personality Creation: Based on the analysis, We use [OpenAI assistants](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) and [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/) to create personality profiles that reflect each userâ€™s TV show preferences.

## Project Structure

This section provides an overview of the folder structure and key technologies used in the whoami.tv project. Understanding this will help you effectively navigate and customize the project.

### Technology Stack

- [Gandalf Connect](https://github.com/gandalf-network/connect): Lets your users to link their accounts to the [Gandalf Network](https://gandalf.network/).
- [eyeofsauron](https://github.com/gandalf-network/eyeofsauron): Command-line tool designed to generate the necessary files that makes it super easy to query user data from the Gandalf Network.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): The core framework that powers the server-side rendering and static generation.
- [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/): Inngest works by serving an HTTP API endpoint which exposes functions that can be called on-demand.
- [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma): NodeJS ORM.
- [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started): Fetching detailed information about shows and actors.
- [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/): Fetching tv show rotten tomato scores.
- [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview): Used to generate user personas based on their TV show preferences.
- [Perplexity API](https://www.perplexity.ai/): Used for browsing the internet to get information about characters from a TV show.
